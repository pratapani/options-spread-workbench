# BPS Trading Workbench

BPS Trading Workbench is a Bull Put Spread opportunity tracker for options
screening and analysis. It runs the market-data scanner on an EC2 instance and
provides a Windows dashboard for configuring a scan, reviewing the returned
opportunities, ranking setups, and exploring the resulting CSV locally.

The application is intended for research and screening. It does not place
orders or provide investment advice.

## What It Does

The scanner evaluates Bull Put Spread opportunities for a selected expiry date.
The dashboard limits the expiry selector to today through a maximum of three
months ahead.

Before each scan, the user can configure:

- Expiry date
- Minimum OTM percentage
- Maximum OTM percentage
- Maximum spread width
- Minimum Profit:Loss ratio
- Maximum Profit:Loss ratio
- Minimum open interest
- Minimum volume
- Optional IV spread and grade filters in the dashboard

The scanner uses executable-side option prices:

- Sell the higher-strike put at its bid
- Buy the lower-strike put at its offer
- Credit = sell bid - buy offer

The result includes strikes, spot price, bid/offer quotes, implied volatility,
OTM distance, spread width, credit, lot size, maximum profit, maximum loss,
breakeven, and Profit:Loss ratio.

The dashboard can rank and filter opportunities by the current screening
universe. Scanner results are ranked primarily by farther OTM distance, then
sell-leg IV, narrower spread width, and Profit:Loss ratio. The dashboard also
calculates a score and grade for easier comparison.

## Architecture

```text
Windows React/Vite dashboard
        |
        v
Windows Node controller
        |
        | SSH/SCP
        v
EC2 Python scanner -> bps_results.csv
        |
        | SCP result download
        v
Windows dashboard
```

Windows owns the UI and controller. EC2 owns the Python scanner and its Python
virtual environment. The UI and controller are not deployed to EC2.

## Requirements

Install or have available on Windows:

- Git
- Node.js and npm
- Windows OpenSSH (`ssh` and `scp`)
- AWS CLI v2
- An EC2 SSH private key in PEM format

The EC2 instance must have:

- Amazon Linux or another Linux distribution with Python 3
- Network access to the Breeze API
- An SSH security-group rule for TCP port 22
- A Python virtual environment created by the deployment script

## Breeze Connect API

The EC2 scanner uses the `breeze-connect` Python package to connect to the
ICICI Direct Breeze API. The dependency is listed in
`services/scanner/requirements.txt` and is installed into the EC2 virtual
environment by `npm.cmd run deploy:scanner`.

The scanner uses Breeze to authenticate, load the available NFO contract
universe, retrieve option-chain quotes, and read the spot and option market
data used to calculate Bull Put Spread opportunities. The application performs
screening and analysis only; it does not submit, modify, or cancel orders.

The scanner requires these Breeze credentials:

```env
BREEZE_API_KEY=your-breeze-api-key
BREEZE_API_SECRET=your-breeze-api-secret
BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN=your-breeze-session-token
```

The API key and secret must be available to the scanner on EC2, normally in the
EC2-side `.env` file in the scanner directory. Do not put them in this public
repository, the Windows project `.env`, the README, or the browser UI.

Breeze session tokens are short-lived and should be refreshed according to the
Breeze authentication process. For a one-off scan, the user can paste a fresh
session token into the dashboard. The Windows controller uploads that token to
EC2 over SCP for the scan, the scanner uses it in preference to the fallback
`BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN` value, and the temporary uploaded token file is deleted
after it is read.

If the token is invalid, expired, or missing, the scanner stops before market
data collection and reports an authentication failure in the controller log.

## Clone And Configure

Clone the public repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/pratapani/bps-trading-workbench.git
cd bps-trading-workbench
```

Install the Windows dashboard dependencies:

```powershell
npm.cmd run install:web
```

Create the local deployment configuration:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the actual EC2 and AWS values:

```env
BPS_EC2_HOST=13.223.163.39
BPS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID=i-your-instance-id
BPS_EC2_USER=ec2-user
BPS_EC2_KEY_PATH=C:\path\to\bps-scanner-key.pem
BPS_EC2_REMOTE_DIR=/home/ec2-user/bps-scanner
BPS_EC2_SECURITY_GROUP_ID=sg-your-security-group-id
BPS_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
BPS_CONTROLLER_PORT=8787
```

`.env` is ignored by Git. Do not commit it.

The SSH key can be stored in an ignored project folder such as:

```text
keys/bps-scanner-key.pem
```

The `.pem` file is ignored by Git. Do not commit it or place it in a public
repository.

## AWS CLI Setup

The on-demand launch preflight uses the AWS EC2 API. Configure the AWS CLI once on
Windows using an IAM identity or SSO profile:

```powershell
aws configure
```

Use `us-east-1` or the region where the EC2 instance exists. For SSO:

```powershell
aws configure sso
aws sso login
```

Verify authentication:

```powershell
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

The required permissions are:

```text
ec2:DescribeInstances
ec2:StartInstances
ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups
ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress
```

These permissions are used by the local PowerShell preflight and by the Node
controller's UI-triggered EC2 readiness check.

Use a least-privilege IAM identity for this workflow. Avoid using the AWS root
account for routine development.

## On-Demand Scan Session

Start the controller and dashboard whenever you want to scan the market and get
the latest Bull Put Spread opportunities:

```powershell
npm.cmd start
```

The local launch preflight prepares the EC2 instance and SSH access before the
dashboard starts. The sequence is:

1. Read the EC2 instance ID and AWS region from `.env`.
2. Check the EC2 instance state.
3. Start the instance if it is stopped.
4. Wait until the instance reaches `running`.
5. Resolve the instance's public IP and set `BPS_EC2_HOST` for the local session.
6. Get the current Windows public IP from `https://api.ipify.org`.
7. Check the configured security group's TCP/22 inbound rules.
8. Add the current Windows IP as `<ip>/32` when it is missing.
9. Start the Node controller on `127.0.0.1:8787`.
10. Start the Vite dashboard, normally on `http://localhost:5173/` (Vite may choose
    another port if 5173 is already occupied).

The dashboard's **Run EC2 Scan** action also performs an EC2 readiness check.
This allows a scan started directly from the UI to recover if the instance was
stopped after the local launcher had already started. The controller uses the
AWS CLI to check/start the configured instance, waits for `running`, resolves
the current public IP, and then waits for SSH to become reachable before
continuing with the scan.

The launch check does not remove old IP rules. This avoids unexpectedly
disconnecting another approved workstation; old rules can be removed manually
from AWS when no longer needed.

If the controller is already running on port 8787, the launcher reuses it
instead of starting a duplicate process.

## Run A Scan

After the dashboard opens:

1. Enter a fresh Breeze session token in the scan panel.
2. Select an expiry date from today through the next three months.
3. Set OTM, spread width, Profit:Loss, open-interest, and volume limits.
4. Start the scan.

The Windows controller uploads the scan configuration and the UI-entered
session token to EC2 over SCP. The controller updates only
`BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN` in the EC2-side `.env` and removes the temporary remote
token file. The scanner then reads the refreshed value from `.env`, authenticates
with Breeze, runs the scanner, and writes `bps_results.csv`. The controller
copies the result back to Windows as a timestamped archive and updates
`latest_bps_results.csv` for the dashboard.

Opportunities are market-dependent and can change as prices, volatility,
liquidity, and open interest move. Run a new on-demand scan whenever you need a
fresh view; previously downloaded results represent the market conditions at
the time that scan was executed.

The controller removes its local temporary token file after the upload/update
operation and removes the temporary remote token file after updating the
EC2-side `.env`. If no UI token is uploaded, the scanner uses the existing
`BREEZE_SESSION_TOKEN` value from the EC2-side `.env`.

## Deploy Scanner Changes

Deployment is separate from on-demand UI launch. Run it after changing the Python
scanner or its runtime configuration:

```powershell
npm.cmd run deploy:scanner
```

The deployment sequence is:

1. Check and start the EC2 instance when necessary.
2. Resolve its current public IP.
3. Connect with Windows SSH.
4. Create a timestamped ZIP backup of existing active scanner files.
5. Upload `bps_engine.py`, `scan_universe.py`, `scan_config.json`, and
   `requirements.txt`.
6. Create or update the EC2 `.venv`.
7. Install the Python requirements.

Backups are stored on EC2 under:

```text
/home/ec2-user/bps-scanner/backups/scanner-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip
```

The deployment does not upload credentials, UI dependencies, archived scripts,
or generated results.

To run the deployment script directly:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\deploy-scanner.ps1
```

## Tests

The repository currently has eight dependency-free Python unit tests for the
BPS engine:

```powershell
npm.cmd run test:python
```

The tests cover normal-distribution and Black-Scholes calculations, executable
bid/offer pricing, invalid spreads, liquidity and OTM filters, invalid spot
input, and ranking behavior.

The live Breeze scan, AWS security-group update, SSH connection, and EC2
deployment are integration operations and require real credentials and network
access. They are not run by the unit-test command.

## Security And Operational Notes

- Never commit `.env`, AWS credentials, Breeze credentials, session tokens, or
  PEM private keys.
- Rotate credentials immediately if they are exposed.
- Use an IAM identity with only the permissions required by this workflow.
- The local launcher and the UI scan controller use the AWS CLI to check/start
  the configured EC2 instance. The AWS CLI must therefore be installed and
  authenticated on Windows.
- The configured EC2 instance uses an Elastic IP, so its public address remains
  stable across stop/start operations. The scripts still resolve the current
  address from the instance ID rather than relying on that assumption.
- The current Windows public IP is added to the EC2 security group for SSH when
  required. Old approved IP rules are not automatically removed.
- Keep the controller bound to localhost unless remote access is deliberately
  configured.
